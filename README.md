# bootcamp-assignments
A repository for completing my homework assignments for the UMD AppDev club Web Devlopment bootcamp

Currently learning version control with git and brushing up on basic HTML/CSS

New features thus far: I fixed my experience section by using flexbox to organize the experience section using rows. Rather than having work experience under technical experience, I have it beside it! I also used the CSS box model to separate the two sections by editing the margins and padding.
