# bootcamp-personal-website
A repository for build my personal website from UMD App Dev Club's lessons

Currently learning version control with git and brushing up on basic HTML/CSS

New features thus far: I fixed my experience section by using flexbox to organize the experience section using rows. Rather than having work experience under technical experience, I have it beside it! I also used the CSS box model to separate the two sections by editing the margins and padding.

Added a flexbox, and pictures of the homework assigned to us.
